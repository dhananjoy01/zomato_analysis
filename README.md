### Customer Analysis

#### 1. Top Ordered Dishes by Specific Customer
```sql
WITH customer_orders AS (
    SELECT 
        o.order_item,
        COUNT(*) AS order_count,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS rank
    FROM orders o
    JOIN customer c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
    WHERE c.customer_name = 'Rahul Verma'
    AND o.order_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '2 years'
    GROUP BY o.order_item
)
SELECT order_item, order_count
FROM customer_orders
